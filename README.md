Help me!

The presentation for our new genius blockchain business for Friedrich is in 1 hour and I have no access to my swiDOC account where I stored the presentation...

I stored the login credential and a reference to my account email in a file and encrypted it with the encrypt.py program.

The only thing I remember is that I used a password from the 100k most used passwords and used hashing to generate a secret key and stuff for encrypting it.

Also the first few characters of the original file were "oriXXXX".

Please help me to find the right key and decrypt the file for me.
Hopefully we can find out my credentials then...
